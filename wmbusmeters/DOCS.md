# Home Assistant Community Add-on: wmbusmeters (W-MBus to MQTT)

This add-on allows you to acquire utility meter readings **without** the vendors bridge or gateway as long as they support C1, T1 or S1 telegrams using the wireless mbus protocol (WMBUS).


## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other community-driven Home Assistant add-on.

1. Navigate to Add-ons > Add-on Store > Repositories
1. Add https://github.com/pawjensen/hassio-addon
1. Install Wmbusmeters
1. Plug-in your radio receiver USB dongle
1. Initial Configuration at the [Configuration](#configuration) tab
    1. Select data path (default is `/config/addon/wmbusmeter`)
1. Start the addon container
1. In the logs you should see all the W-Mbus telegrams that wmbusmeter is able to receive. <br> _If you don't see anything, check the logs carefully. <br> If you configure it late evening or in the night, please note the radio modules often send telegrams less frequently than in typical working hours or don't send them at all. <br> If your antenna is in a distance to the radio module, try to locate it closer._
1. Final configuration at the [Configuration](#configuration) tab
    1. [Set the device at the config](#section-wmbusmeters-configuration)
    1. [Configure the meters](#section-meters)
1. Finally, don't forget about adding the MQTT sensor into your Home Assistant or select `enable mqtt discovery`.

## Configuration

Once the wmbusmeters is receiving the telegrams you need to configure your meter using `meters` section (see below) to pass the readings to MQTT topic.

### Section: `wmbusmeters config location`

Path relative for add-on where wmbusmeters files are stored:
```
/logs/meter_readings/
/etc/wmbusmeters.conf
/etc/wmbusmeters.d/
```

### Section: `wmbusmeters configuration`

Content of this section will be used as `wmbusmeters.conf`.
If two values for configuration parameter is needed, like:
```yaml
donotprobe: /dev/ttyAMA0
donotprobe: /dev/ttyUSB0
```
In web configuration interface it should be provided in one line using `;` delimiter between values, like: `donotprobe=/dev/ttyAMA0;/dev/ttyUSB0`

**Note** edit the configuration in the menu, and not the file `wmbusmeters.conf`.

### Section: `meters`

Specify your meters configuration parameters. The `driver` and `id` values can be read from the add-on logs after the initial start (with empty `meters` configuration). The `name` is your label for the meter and `key` is the encryption key to decrypt telegrams (if your meter use any).

**Note** edit the configuration in the menu, and not the meters files.

### Section: `Custom MQTT configuration`

By default it is not enabled and leverages the _Moquitto broker_ addon details provided by supervisor. However, you can specify the custom mqtt broker connection details here.

### Section: `Enable MQTT discovery`

Enable this to make it Home Assistant auto discovery the configurated meters.

## Home Assistant integration

Finally, you need to tell Home Assistant how to extract the readings from the MQTT. You can add the following sensor definition into your `mqtt:` section of `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - state_topic: "wmbusmeters/MainWater"
      json_attributes_topic: "wmbusmeters/MainWater"
      unit_of_measurement: mÂ³
      value_template: "{{ value_json.total_m3 }}"
      name: Water usage
      icon: "mdi:gauge"
      state_class: total_increasing
      device_class: water
```

_Please note: 

- `MainWater` is the water meter name used in `meters` configuration._
- `device_class` is necessary to be adapt on your meters type (water, gas, etc.) [see here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#available-device-classes)
